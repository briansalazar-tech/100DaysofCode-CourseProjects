# Day 5 Project: Password Generator
## Topics covered in leason include
- For Loops
## Project
The goal for this project was to create a CLI password generator program.

The program first starts out by asking the user how many letters, numbers, and symbols they would like included in the generated password. The program then selects random characters from the letters, numbers, and symbols list per the quantity specified by the user and appends those values to the password_list list. Those list items are then shuffled and concatenated to generate a password which is then returned to the user.
