# Day 77: Computation with NumPy and N-Dimensional Arrays
## Lesson Overview
**Day 77** introduces the NumPy library and working with N-Dimensional Arrays.
## Project
### Project Files
#### Day77of100DaysofCode.ipynb
This file is the Python notebook used to complete this lesson. The file in this project folder is the completed notebook.
#### Yummy_macarons.jpg
This image is used at the end of the notebook to provide additional practice with image manipulation.
### Modules Used
#### NumPy
**NumPy** is the focus of this notebook and is used to complete the various exercises in the file.
#### MatPlotLib
**MatPlotLib** is used to create a line plot and a noise image from array values.
#### Scipy
The **scipy** library contains the image of the raccoon that is used in the image manipulation part of the library.
#### PIL
The **PIL** library is used for reading image files.
### Project Walkthrough
#### Working with Arrays
The notebook begins by working with ndarrays. The lesson starts by working with 1-dimensional arrays, 2-dimensional arrays, and n-dimensional arrays. The lesson proceeds to mini challenges, which have activities such as creating arrays from a range of numbers, slicing, creating a line graph from array data, and creating an image from array values.
#### Linear Algebra with Vectors
After completing the two mini challenge blocks, the following two blocks demonstrate the difference between mathematical operations on vectors vs Python lists.
#### Broadcasting and Scalars
This section of the notebook also performs mathematical operations on arrays. The two examples used add a value and multiply all entries in the example array.
#### Matrix Multiplication with @ and .matmul()
This section of the notebook uses NumPy’s matmul method to perform multiplication operations on two arrays of different sizes.
#### Manipulating Images as ndarrays
Rounding out this lesson, the lesson ends with working with images and NumPy. Operations performed include turning the image upside down, converting an image to black and white, and inverting the colors. The image used is from SciPy’s misc library. The yummy_macarons.jpg file in this folder is used for additional practice.
