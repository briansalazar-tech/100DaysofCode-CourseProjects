# Day 61: Forms with Flask WTForms
## Lesson Overview
**Day 61** of the course did not have a project associated with it but instead provided additional practice with working with HTML forms and Flask. The day starts by working with an HTML form but then introduces Flask-WTForms for creating forms. With WTForms, the process of creating a form and working with Flask was simplified. The lesson then proceeds to introduce template inheritance and how it can be used to create a uniform look for web pages on a website. The lesson wraps up by integrating Bootstrap with the Flask elements and further simplifying the process of creating a form using the render_form method.

Below is a bullet point of the concepts covered in this lesson.
- Template inheritance
