# 100 Days of Code Udemy Course by Angela Yu
I have created this repo to refresh knowledge covered in the 100 Days of Code course. I have previously uploaded the portfolio projects for this course so I will only be adding the end of day projects covered in the course excluding the portfolio projects.

The goal of this repo is to refresh myself on concepts covered in the course however, another goal I have in this repo is to practice using Git and version control and work on documentation skills with each of the projects created in the course.
