# Day 1 Project: Band Name Generator
Day 1 of the 100 Days of Code course builds a band name generator. The lesson and challenge touch on using print, taking inputs and assigning variables.

The project first prints to the screen welcoming the user to the Band Name Generator Program. The program takes two inputs, **city** and **pet name**. Once the inputs are entered, the program then prints the suggested bandname made up of those two variables to the terminal.
