# Day 65: Concepts of Good Web Design
## Lesson Overview
**Day 65** takes a break from the Flask website projects and focuses on the concepts used to make good websites. The lesson goes over the following four pillars.

### Color Theory
When it comes to color theory, keep the following in mind:
- Mood of the color palette
- Combining colors: Analogous colors vs complementary colors

### Understanding Typography
Font families include the following:
- Serif typefaces
- San-serif typefaces

Keep the following in mind:
- Stick to less fonts to keep a design coherent.
- Find fonts that have similar moods and time eras.
- You can create contrast by using serif and san-serif fonts and or using fonts that have different weights.


### Effective User Interface (UI) Design
When considering UI, keep the following points in mind:
1.	Hierarchy
    - The most important information should be more eye-catching. This can be accomplished with proper color choice and properly sizing content to draw user’s attention
2.	Layout
    - Having mixed elements (text blocks, pictures, etc.) can keep a web page interesting.
3.	Alignment
    - Alignment points should be reduced to keep the interface coherent. Proper alignment keeps a web site looking professional.
4.	Whitespace
    - Whitespace refers to the empty space around elements. More whitespace makes content look scares and premium.
5.	Audience
    - Design for your audience and keep in mind what appeals to your audience.

### User Experience (UX) Design
The lesson goes over how user experience is not meant to be visible and encompasses the following points:
1.	Simplicity
    - Keep things simple.
2.	Consistency
    - Keep people's reading patterns in mind (F pattern vs Z pattern)
    - Keep your websites design consistent.
3.	Design for all devices
    - Design for all types of devices including desktop and phones.
4.	Don’t use dark patterns
    - Don’t user predatory design patterns and trick users.
