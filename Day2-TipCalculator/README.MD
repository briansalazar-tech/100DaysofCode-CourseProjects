# Day 2 Project: Tip Calculator
Concepts covered in this lesson include data types (strings, integers, boolean, float), typeof(), len(), mathematical operations, type conversion and f strings.

The program first starts by asking for inputs from the user. These inputs include the total bill, tip percentage, and the number of people to split the tip with.

The decimal percentage for the tip percentage is calculated and added to the total bill. The bill is then divided by the number of people that will split the bill. 

After calculating these values, the output returns the total bill and the amount of money that each person will pay if dividing the bill evenly.
