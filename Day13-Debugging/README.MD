# Day 13: Debugging
## Lession Overview
This lesson didn't have a project at the end of the day. At the end of the lesson, the goal was to solve three problem challenges.


## Steps to identify a bug
1.	Describe the problem
    - What is the desired behavior?
2.	Reproducing the bug
    - Why does the bug only occur sometimes?
    - When does the error happen?
3.	Play computer
    - Pretend you are the computer and follow line by line to understand the computer's logic.
4.	Fix errors before proceeding
    - Fix errors as they are identified before proceeding with additional code.
    - Identify error messages that are output to identify what is causing errors.
    - Use Try/Except blocks where errors can arise. Ex. Entering a string vs an int.
5.	Use print statements
    - Print statements can be used to validate that the proper value is being returned.
6.	Use a debugger
    - Debuggers can be used to walk through code, including stepping over and stepping into code, using breakpoints, etc.
## Additional Tips
1.	Take a break
2.	Ask a friend
3.	Run your code often 
4.	Ask StackOverflow
